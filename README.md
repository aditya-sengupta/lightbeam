# lightbeam
Simulate light through weakly guiding waveguides using the finite-differences beam propagation method on an adaptive mesh.

## installation
The master branch includes the raw files of the beam propagation code. For a packaged version of the code, you can use the <package> branch. Just run <pip install git+https://github.com/jw-lin/lightbeam.git@package>. You will also need the following packages: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Numba, and Numexpr.

## getting started
A jupyter notebook tutorial is provided in the <tutorial> folder. For Python script examples, check out script run_bpm_example.py and the associated config file config_example.py.
